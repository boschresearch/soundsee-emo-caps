# CLAP4Emo: Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) for Speech Emotion Retrieval

The ChatGPT-generated data resource (i.e., emotion class captions) to reproduce our experimental results for the proposed [CLAP4Emo framework](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10447102). This work is presented and published in ICASSP'24. This repository contains detailed information about the utilized data (**GPTEmo_Caps.json**) used to train the model, along with the corresponding prompt list used to compute speech emotion retrieval performance as reported in the paper.


## Purpose of this Data Resource

This data resource is solely released and published as part of the [publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10447102) effort to help academic researchers benchmark or reproduce results. It will neither be maintained nor monitored in any way.


## Resource Descriptions

JSON file **GPTEmo_Caps.json** contains list of captions associating to a specific emotion type as the dictionary key,
* "A": "angry"
* "H": "happy"
* "N": "neutral"
* "S": "sad"

```python
import json

with open("./GPTEmo_Caps.json") as f:
	emocaps = json.load(f)

# get the list of "angry" captions generated by ChatGPT
angry_captions = emocaps["A"]
```
